# LiteraryList

LiteraryList is a web-application that allows users to search for books, view the average book rating via the GoodReads API, write reviews for books and view reviews that other users have written.  It also features a user-login system, allowing users to register and login. The data for searchable books, user reviews and login info is stored in a SQL database. This was project 1 for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming in Python and JavaScript.

This application was built using Python and Flask with an HTML/CSS frontend.
